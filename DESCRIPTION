Title: Functions for usung Elasticsearch from R
Version: 0.1
Date: 2015-03-13
Author: Alex Ioannides
Maintainer: Alex Ioanndies <alex.ioannides@yahoo.co.ukt>
Description: The purpose of these functions are help the user interact with Elasticsearch from R, without haveing to specify any queries,
    filters, or aggregations using the JSON-based RESTful API. Instead, we have wrapped the API to created the ability to use it using a DSL
    based on lists (with a lot of sugar thrown in). All Elasticsearch CRUD operations proceed via the Elasticsearch's bulk API, so there are
    not limits on the amount of data that can pass between R and Elasticsearch.
